[**AgReFed**](https://www.agrefed.org.au/) is a cooperative of Data Provider Communities with a shared vision to enable **[Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR](https://www.agrefed.org.au/FAIRdata))** agricultural data to accelerate innovation and increase the profitability and sustainability of Australian agriculture, through the creation of a unifying federation for the sharing of agricultural data amongst like-minded Data Provider Communities.

AgReFed is committed to pursuing a shared mission to unlock the potential of agricultural data from Australian research organisations, government, agricultural producers and other agricultural industry players by providing a data sharing platform enabling the use of FAIR data to increase the application of knowledge, accelerate innovation and improve decision making.

AgReFed pursues this mission by:

- Bringing together and aligning independent organisations to make strategic and technical decisions about data sharing
- Providing a governance and data stewardship framework for collective decision making
- Providing the infrastructure, tools, and resources for Data Provider Communities to develop the capacity to make agricultural data FAIR
- Enabling increasingly FAIR data from research organisations to be available for use by the broader agricultural research community
- Incorporating and enabling access to complementary data important to agricultural research

The Sydney Informatics Hub (SIH) is a [**Core Research Facility**](https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities.html) of the University of Sydney. Core Research Facilities centralise essential research equipment and services that would otherwise be too expensive or impractical for individuals, Schools or Faculties to purchase and maintain.

We provide a wide range of research services to aid investigators, such as:

- [Training and workshops](https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/workshops-and-training.html)
- [Project consulting and assistance](https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/project-support.html) with Statistics, Data Science, Research Engineering, Bioinformatics, Modeling/Simulation/Visualisation, High Performance Computing.
- [Research data management](https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/digital-research-infrastructure.html) consulting and platform support.

We also aim to cultivate a data *community*, organising monthly [Hacky Hours](https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/workshops-and-training/hacky-hour.html), outside training events (eg NVIDIA, Pawsey Center), and data/coding-related events. Look out for everything happening on our [calendar](https://www.sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/workshops-and-training/training-calendar.html) or contact us at sih.info\@sydney.edu.au to get some digital collaboration going.
