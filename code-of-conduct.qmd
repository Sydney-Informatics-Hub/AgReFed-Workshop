We expect all attendees of our training to follow our code of conduct, including bullying, harassment and discrimination prevention policies.

In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours at all our events and on our platforms:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show courtesy and respect towards other community members
