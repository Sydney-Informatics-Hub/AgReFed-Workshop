title: Setting up RStudio Cloud
---

RStudio Cloud is a free, web-based RStudio IDE that you can use to run R code in your browser. It is a great way to get started with R without having to install anything on your computer. You can also use it to share your code with others. We encourage you to use RStudio Cloud for the workshop as you do not need to install anything on your computer. If you do not have an RStudio account, follow the steps below.

### Setting up RStudio Cloud

Go to [https://rstudio.cloud/](https://rstudio.cloud/) and sign up on the "Cloud Free" Plan.

You will need to provide an email address and a password. You can also sign up using your Google or Github account -- simply click on those buttons, and follow the authentication steps.

<!-- ::: callout-note
In the near future, we will be able to provide AgReFed workshop participants with a virtual machine on the Nectar Research Cloud. This will allow you to use RStudio Server on a virtual machine. Instructions will be provided when this is available.

<!-- ## Binder (optional)

Want to play around with `dataharvester` without an RStudio Cloud account? Launch our Binder instance by clicking on the button below. Binder should only be used in a test environment as Binder instances are not persistent and will be deleted after a period of inactivity.

## Need help?

If you are stuck at any point, we have a dedicated [Troubleshooting](/rdocs/r99-troubleshooting.qmd) section that you can refer to. This section will be updated as we receive more questions.

## What's next?

Now that you have `dataharvester` installed, you are ready to start the workshop. Workshop links are available in the sidebar. You should also check out the landing page for the [R Workshop](/rdocs/r00-workshop.qmd) for updates.
