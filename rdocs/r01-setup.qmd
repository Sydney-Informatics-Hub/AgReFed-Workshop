## Google Earth Engine

::: callout-important

To save time, it is important to sign up for **Google Earth Engine** access and 
an **RStudio Cloud** account before the workshop.
:::

To use Google Earth Engine, you must link an existing Google acccount to the service. The signup link is [here](https://earthengine.google.com/signup/). Once you have logged into Google, you will be presented with a signup form.

**Make sure to fill in the form with genuine answers.** In the section asking *"What would you like to accomplish with Earth Engine?"*,  please provide a proper learning/academic reason, e.g. "I want to use Google Earth Engine to learn about remote sensing and image processing for my research". **Do not just copy and paste the response from here as Google may reject your application.**

![Fill in the form, submit and wait for an email confirmation](assets/gee_signup.jpg)

Once you have submitted, you should receive a confirmation via email within minutes (to a couple of hours).

## RStudio Cloud

RStudio Cloud is a free, web-based RStudio IDE that you can use to run R code in your browser. It is a great way to get started with R without having to install anything on your computer. You can also use it to share your code with others. If this is the first time you're using RStudio Cloud, you can find a guide [here](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/guide). Expand the section below to learn how to sign up and get started.

### Setting up RStudio Cloud

Go to [https://rstudio.cloud/](https://rstudio.cloud/), and sign up on the "Cloud Free" Plan. 

![Sign up to the Cloud Free Plan on RStudio Cloud](assets/rstudiocloud_signup.jpg)

You will need to provide an email address and a password. You can also sign up using your Google or Github account -- simply click on those buttons, and follow the instructions (you may need to authorise RStudio Cloud to access these accounts).

You will be automatically directed to the RStudio Cloud home page, which looks like this:

You are now ready to join the shared space for this course. See below for the link.

:::

We encourage you to use RStudio Cloud for the workshop as you do not need to install anything on your computer. Simply [log in](https://login.rstudio.cloud/login) with your free account and follow along with the workshop.

<!-- ::: callout-note
In the near future, we will be able to provide AgReFed workshop participants with a virtual machine on the Nectar Research Cloud. This will allow you to use RStudio Server on a virtual machine. Instructions will be provided when this is available.

## Binder

Want to play around with `dataharvester` without an RStudio Cloud account? Launch our Binder instance by clicking on the button below. Binder should only be used in a test environment as Binder instances are not persistent and will be deleted after a period of inactivity.

## RStudio Desktop 

::: callout-note
If you prefer to use RStudio Desktop, a setup vignette is available on the `dataharvester` site. We will not support this option during the workshop, but you can use it to follow along with the workshop at your own pace. 


We will not be able to help you troubleshoot any issues you may encounter while we are teaching. You can, however, submit an issue on the `dataharvester` Github repository to document your problems and we will try to help you as best we can after the workshop sessions. 
:::

<!-- 
::: callout-important
Choosing this option means that you have decided to install R and RStudio on your computer. This is not recommended for beginners as it can be a complicated process. If you are unsure, please use RStudio Cloud.

You must know how to debug issues if you choose to use RStudio Desktop. **Please set up RStudio before the workshop so that you can debug early and focus on the content (see below).**
:::

:::{.callout-note appearance="simple" collapse="true"}
### **Step 1**: Install/Update R and RStudio

 If you already have R and RStudio installed, make sure you have the latest versions. At a minimum, you will need [R v4.21](https://cran.r-project.org/){target="_blank"} and [RStudio v2022.07.2](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/){target="_blank"}.
:::

:::{.callout-note appearance="simple" collapse="true"}
### **Step 2**: Install and load the `dataharvester` package

Install the `"dataharvester"` package from GitHub. You will need either the `"devtools"` or `"remotes"` package (recommended) installed to do this.

::: callout-warning
If you are a Windows user and choose to use `"devtools"`, you may need to install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/){target="_blank"} first.
:::

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("sydney-informatics-hub/dataharvester")
```
Don't forget to load the package:

```r
library(dataharvester)
```
:::

:::{.callout-note appearance="simple" collapse="true"}
### **Step 3**: Install dependencies

The `dataharvester` package has a number of dependencies that you will need to install, since the code is in Python. Luckily, there is a function to install these dependencies for you. Run the following code, which will install dependencies in a conda environment called "r-reticulate":

```r
initialise_harvester("r-reticulate")
```
This function must always be run prior to using `dataharvester` functions. It may take a few minutes to run the first time. For subsequent sessions, `initialise_harvester()` should take only a few seconds to run.

::: callout-important
During this step, you may be asked to install `r-miniconda`, which is basically [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html){target="_blank"}. This is a package that allows you to install and use Python packages within R through the [Conda binary package manager](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html){target="_blank"}. 

If you already have Python installed, R may still ask you to install miniconda. This is because miniconda is a separate package from Python, and is not the same as the Python package manager `pip`. Importantly, miniconda is *almost* necessary for Windows users as it allows you to install certain Python *and* non-Python packages without having to install a full version of Python and running installation commands in the command line. These include the [GDAL](https://gdal.org/){target="_blank"} binary which is a translator library for raster and vector geospatial data formats, and the [PROJ](https://proj.org/){target="_blank"} library which is a cartographic projection and coordinate transformation library.

### **Step 4 (Final)**: Authenticate with Google Earth Engine

If you have a [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/){target="_blank"} account, you can initialise the package with your credentials. This will allow you to access Google Earth Engine data.

To activate Google Earth Engine, simply include `earthengine = TRUE` when initialising:
  
```r
initialise_harvester("r-reticulate", earthengine = TRUE)
```
Follow the instructions carefully, as Google Earth Engine requires you to authenticate with a Google account. You will need to copy and paste a link into your browser, and then copy and paste the resulting code back into R.

If you are authenticating from a server environment or RStudio Cloud, you may need to use a different authentication method. See the [Troubleshooting](/rdocs/r99-troubleshooting.qmd) section and look for the section "Google Earth Engine authentication".

## Need help?

If you are stuck at any point, we have a dedicated [Troubleshooting](/rdocs/r99-troubleshooting.qmd) section that you can refer to. This section will be updated as we receive more questions.

## What's next?

Now that you have `dataharvester` installed, you are ready to start the workshop. Workshop links are available in the sidebar. You should also check out the landing page for the [R Workshop](rdocs/r00-workshop.qmd) for updates.
