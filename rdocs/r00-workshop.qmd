title: "R Workshop"
---

The R Workshop is intended for researchers and students who are more familiar with the R and RStudio environments in their workflows. We have created an R package that allows you to interface with the Data-Harvester without running Python code. This workshop will cover the basics of the R `dataharvester` package and how to use it.

## Before you begin

Make sure that you have read the [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct.qmd) and the [FAQ](/faq.qmd), especially the "What are the pre-requisites?" section [here](/faq.qmd#pre-requisites). Essentially, you need to be familiar with R and RStudio.

### Local installation

The following should already be installed on your computer:

- R
- RStudio
- Quarto

If you do not have these installed, please follow the instructions in the [R Setup Page](/rdocs/r01-setup.qmd).
