title: Setting up Google Earth Engine
---

The Data Harvester utilises the Google Earth Engine API. To use this functionality, you must sign up for the service (with just your normal google account).

Click [here to sign up to Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/signup/), follow the instructions to log in (or create a Google Account, if you do not already have one). Eventually, you will be asked to fill in a web form.

**Make sure to fill in the form with genuine answers.** In the section asking *"What would you like to accomplish with Earth Engine?"*, provide a reasonable explanation of how you would utilise the geospatial data obtained from Earth Engine in a couple of sentences. A proper description will almost guarantee that you will be approved in minutes.

Once you have submitted, you should receive a confirmation via email within minutes (to a couple of hours). This is why signing up now is important - you may not be able to use Google Earth Engine functionality if you sign up during the workshop.
