title: Setting up Python environment
---

# Jupyter Hub

We will be using an online "Jupyter Hub" python environment for the workshop. This environment contains all the required libraries and packages pre-configured and allows you to use Python "notebooks" on-demand with a "Jupyter Lab" ide.

## Instructions

Navigate your browser to [https://jupyterhub.rc.nectar.org.au/](https://jupyterhub.rc.nectar.org.au/)

Click the *Sign in with AAF* button.

Go through your institutional sign-in process.

> If you have no idea what AAF is or your institution is not listed, let us know and we can provide an alternate account for the workshop!

Select the *AgReFed Python environment* server option and then click *START*. The environment has all the dependant software required to run the Geodata Harvester.

You should now be in a "Jupyter Lab" interface. Select the *Notebook > Python3 (ipykernel)* to get started!

# Optional: Local Install

The Geodata-Harvester is available through the *conda* package manager, installation can be accomplished with:

```
conda install -c conda-forge geodata_harvester
```

This will compile and install all the dependencies required. You may now invoke the geodata-harvester directly from a python terminal with:

```python
import geodata_harvester as gh
gh.harvest.run()
```

**Note the subtle but important difference in use of an underscore `_` to import the package and the use of a dash `-` to install it!**


## Build the Python environment and use PIP

To build the Geodata Harvester from scratch see the dependencies listed in the [environment file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/geodata-harvester/main/environment.yaml).

To install the dependencies for the Geodata Harvester you may use the environment file directly in conda:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/geodata-harvester/main/environment.yaml
conda env create -f environment.yaml -n gdh
conda activate gdh
```

Now you can install the Geodata Harvester from pypi with:
```
pip install geodata-harvester
```
