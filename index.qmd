Welcome to the AgReFed Geodata-Harvester Workshop pages.

Use the AgReFed Geodata-Harvester to **access, process and download** national (Australian) and global space/time data aimed at agricultural scientists, environmental scientists, ecologists and other researchers.

* Geodata-Harvester [with Python Workshop](/pydocs/py00-workshop).
* Geodata-Harvester [with R Workshop](/rdocs/r00-workshop).

Learn more about the project at the [Geodata-Harvester Homepage](https://sydney-informatics-hub.github.io/geodata-harvester/) and contribute to the source code at our [Code Repository](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/geodata-harvester).

In the workshops, you can learn how to download and summarise geospatial data from a range of sources including:

<!-- 1. **Data retrieval:** access and download a diverse range of geospatial and soil data sources and APIs
2.  **Processing:** Spatial and temporal processing of data, which include image reduction/composition, access to satellite collections, cloud/shadow masking and calculation of spectral indices
3.  **Output:** export data in GeoTIFF or data frames which are ready for modelling workflows

Exercises will involve data retrieval from national/global datasets including: -->

-   [Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia (SLGA)](https://is.gd/i8nF0Z)
-   [SILO Climate Database](https://is.gd/ifJ8tB)
-   [Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of Australia](https://is.gd/ZLFwGs)
-   [Digital Earth Australia (DEA) Geoscience Earth Observations](https://is.gd/gRSlVG)
-   [GSKY Data Server for DEA Geoscience Earth Observations](https://is.gd/zFHxfD)
-   [Google Earth Engine](https://is.gd/VdO3Jx)

In addition, learn the simple spatial and temporal aggregation, visualisation, and summary techniques availble with the Geodata-Harvester.

<!-- Workshops are presented by the [**Sydney Informatics
Hub**](https://www.sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub.html)
in collaboration with the [**Agricultural Research
Federation**](https://www.agrefed.org.au/AgReFedPlatform).  -->
