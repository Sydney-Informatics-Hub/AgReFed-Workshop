## About

Use the AgReFed Data-Harvester to **access, process and download** national (Australian) and global space/time data aimed at agricultural scientists, environmental scientists, ecologists and other researchers.

In the workshops, we will show you how to download and summarise geospatial data from a range of sources including:

<!-- 1. **Data retrieval:** access and download a diverse range of geospatial and soil data sources and APIs
2.  **Processing:** Spatial and temporal processing of data, which include image reduction/composition, access to satellite collections, cloud/shadow masking and calculation of spectral indices
3.  **Output:** export data in GeoTIFF or data frames which are ready for modelling workflows

Exercises will involve data retrieval from national/global datasets including: -->

-   [Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia (SLGA)](https://is.gd/i8nF0Z)
-   [SILO Climate Database](https://is.gd/ifJ8tB)
-   [Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of Australia](https://is.gd/ZLFwGs)
