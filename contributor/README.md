A GitHub Action is used to render the documents. For now, automatic rendering is
restricted to HTML and Jupyter Notebook content only.

Steps:

1. Make your changes
2. If needed, update the document structure in `_quarto.yml` by adding the
   appropriate sections and document names. The file should contain enough
   information to be self-explanatory
3. Push to `main` branch
   
The document will render automatically.
