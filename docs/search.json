    "text": "Objectives\n\nLearn about the AgReFed organisation.\nLearn about the functionalities of the Data Harvester tool.\nLearn about the wider AgReFed ecososytem and tools available.\n\n\nYou can make native Markdown files like this one and include them. Or else you can just put everything in the “R” or “Python” Folder and they will get rendered.\nThis course we will build upon the foundations of the R programming language and teach about the functionality availble within the Data Harvester.\nThe course is presented by the Sydney Informatics Hub on behalf of the Agriculture Research Federation.\n\nWhat is AgReFed?\nAgReFed is great\nMake a list:\n\nAutomate tasks (do things millions of times easily)\nCalculate big numbers (can solve most computational problems)\nFormat and analyse data\nProcess images\n\nThe back-end of the Data Harvester use Python. But we use the “reticulate” package to wrap python code and expose it in R! So you don’t need to worry about the details.\n\nAll free and open-source.\nThere is a large community of people using it all over the world on different projects, which means there is a lot of help and documentation.\nThis is AgReFed\n\n\n\nWhat is the Data-Harvester?\nIt is a R package and Python package, or would we think about it in another way? Here is some code.\nprint(\"Hello World\")\nThe End.\n\nKey points\n\nAgReFed is great.\nUse the Data Harvester.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll materials copyright Sydney Informatics Hub, University of Sydney"

    "text": "This course is aimed at researchers, students, and industry professionals who want to learn about the capabilities of the Data Harvester and get experience using it with R. This course will expand on the foundations of R programming. We will utilise common geoscience data types (geospatial, temporal, vector, raster, etc) to demonstrate a variety of practical workflows and showcase fundamental capabilities of the Data Harvester. We will carry out exploratory, analytical, computational and machine learning analyses on these datasets. At the end of the course you will be able to adapt these workflows to your own datasets.\nThe course is presented by the Sydney Informatics Hub on behalf of the Agricultural Research Federation.\nThe Sydney Informatics Hub (SIH) is a Core Research Facility of the University of Sydney. Core Research Facilities centralise essential research equipment and services that would otherwise be too expensive or impractical for individual Faculties to purchase and maintain. We provide a wide range of research services to aid investigators, such as:\nWe also aim to cultivate a data community, organising monthly Hacky Hours, outside training events (eg NVIDIA, Pawsey Center), and data/coding-related events. Look out for everything happening on our calendar or contact us (at sih.info@sydney.edu.au) to get some digital collaboration going.\nAll materials copyright Sydney Informatics Hub, University of Sydney"

Training will be delivered online, so you will need access to a modern computer with a stable internet connection. Participants are encouraged to setup a local working environment on their local computer (as per the Setup Instructions provided), but a full working online environment will be provided for all participants."

Trainers will be broadcasting from Sydney.\n\nZoom etiquette and how we interact\nSessions will be recorded for attendees only, and it is set up to only record the host shared screen and host audio. We will try and get these uploaded to this site as soon as possible. Please interrupt whenever you want! Ideally, have your camera on and interact as much as possible. There will be someone monitoring the chat-window with any questions you would like to post there. Four hours is a long Zoom session so we have plenty of scheduled breaks combined with a mix of content to be delivered as demos, plus sections as independent exercises, but most of the course will be pretty-hands on with everyone writing their own code. We will use Zoom break-out rooms as needed with the Trainers and participants."
