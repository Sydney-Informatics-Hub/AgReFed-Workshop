You can make native *Markdown* files like this one and include them. Or else you can just put everything in the "R" or "Python" Folder and they will get rendered.

This course we will build upon the foundations of the R programming language and teach about the functionality availble within the Data Harvester.

The course is presented by the Sydney Informatics Hub on behalf of the Agriculture Research Federation.


# What is AgReFed?

AgReFed is great

Make a list:

* Automate tasks (do things millions of times easily)
* Calculate big numbers (can solve most computational problems)
* Format and analyse data
* Process images

The back-end of the Data Harvester use Python. But we use the "reticulate" package to wrap python code and expose it in R! So you don't need to worry about the details.

* All free and open-source. 
* There is a large community of people using it all over the world on different projects, which means there is a lot of help and documentation.
* This is [AgReFed](https://www.agrefed.org.au/AgReFedPlatform)

# What is the Data-Harvester?

It is a R package and Python package, or would we think about it in another way? Here is some code.

```
print("Hello World")
```

The End.
